//13.Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let commute = ["Honda CBR", "Lexus LFA", "Ducati SF"];
console.log("I would like to own", commute[0]);
console.log("I would like to ride", commute[1]);
console.log("I would like to ride", commute[2]);
